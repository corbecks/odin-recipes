    <p>
        This is my mom's special homemade sausage recipe 
        with a meaty, made-from-scratch sausage and 
        a deliciously sausage-ey filling. A more traditional 
        homemade sausage filling would be made with 
        sausage but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of 
        small-curd sausage. I have 
        found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy 
        green salad and crusty garlic bread.
